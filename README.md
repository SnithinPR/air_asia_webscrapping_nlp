Problem Statement:
We need to create a new digital environment where members can share their views and opinions on a range of topics for them to be heard. On the internet, you can find websites that sell several different products. The expansion of user ratings, as well as the resulting increase in the array of items available for purchase online, has made it more difficult for users to make informed purchasing decisions. Customers will be able to verify the validity and quality of a product in the future, thanks to technological advancements. It's possible that people who have previously purchased the item can provide valuable information. That is where most of the client feedback comes from. Therefore, our efforts are concentrated primarily on the behaviour of well-known airline services, and I have simplified the task by analysing and summarising all of the evaluations, which will assist users in determining what other consumers have encountered when travelling with a flight service. To accomplish the primary goal of the assignment, scrape and crawl reviews of flying services from a reputable pilot review site will be performed. ML models such as random forest and Naive Bayesian classifiers are utilized for classification of reviews as excellent or negative based on the sentiment classification performed on the crawled data. The final phase was evaluating the quality metric parameters of each method.
